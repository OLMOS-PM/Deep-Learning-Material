# Deep Learning

Teaching material used for the course [Deep Learning](https://www.uc3m.es/master/machine-learning-health?d=Desktop) in the Master on Machine Learning for Health at Universidad Carlos III Madrid. 

We provide the source code for the slides used in the lectures of the course:
1. Dense Neural Networks. Training, Validation and Regularization
2. Convolutional Neural Networks & Graph Neural Networks
3. Recurrent Neural Networks
4. Attention mechanisms and NLP
5. Unsupervised deep learning: autoregressive models
6. Deep Latent Variable Models. VAEs.
7. GANs
8. Advanced topics in probabilistic models.

Also, we provide with Python Notebooks to illustrate the different concepts.
